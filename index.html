            In this <a href="https://medium.com/@tcsmall/are-high-intensity-workouts-really-better-for-you-549c037b4611"target="_blank">blog post</a> a former competitive distance runner speaks out about how high intensity workouts are not always for better for you as well as how difficult the transition from high intensity to low intensity workouts can be especially in a culture that seems to praise one over the other. Just remember listening to your body and doing what is best for you is at the heart of health. </p>
